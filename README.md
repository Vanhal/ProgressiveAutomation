This mod provides low tech automation tools for common tasks.

_Mod requires Forge to be installed._

The mod has the following blocks and items:

## [Upgrades](../../wiki/Upgrades)
There are 4 tiers of upgrades that will upgrade most of the machine in PA, normally range but they may do something else. Check out the block pages to find out what they do for that block.

## [RFEngine](../../wiki/RFEngine)
You can put this little item into the fuel slot of any PA machine and it will enable the machine to accept and run off RF power instead of solid fuel.

## [Wither Tools](../../wiki/WitherTools)
By infusing the energies of a nether star into basic resources it is possible to create a version of them that seems to be able to withstand a lot more durability. Using these resources you should be able to create tools that can be used for a much longer time, but otherwise have the same properties.

## [The Miner](../../wiki/Miner)
This is a simple mining block that requires fuel and tools to run.
You can read more about how the miner works on the [Miners](../../wiki/Miner) page.

## [The Chopper](../../wiki/Chopper)
A simple machine for creating a tree farm. Requires an axe and fuel to run.
Read more about it on the [Chopper](../../wiki/Chopper) page.

## [The Planter](../../wiki/Planter)
A simple machine for farming various crops and other plants. Requires an hoe and fuel to run.
Read more about it on the [Planter](../../wiki/Planter) page.

## [The Generator](../../wiki/Generator)
This is a simple Generator that just requires fuel to run. All tiers produce the same amount, the later tiers just produce it faster.
You can read more about how the generator works on the [Generator](../../wiki/Generator) page.

## [The Crafter](../../wiki/Crafter)
This machine will, for the cost of a small amount of fuel, craft an item that is selected in the left hand crafting grid using the items that are in the right hand storage slots.
You can read more about how the generator works on the [Crafter](../../wiki/Crafter) page
